Boot Camp Assignment: Create a Tic Tac Toe game using Ruby to run in Terminal

I was asked to create a Tic Tac Toe game in Ruby to play in Terminal. I struggled a lot with trying to decide
whether to use a hash or a two-dimentional array to create the grid, but ultimately ended up on a hash. 
I think that some of this code isn't very DRY, but I tried very hard not to repeat myself too much. 
After getting the game running well I added some "graphics" for the title and utilized the system clear
method in order to keep the screen clean while in play.
